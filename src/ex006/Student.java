// We want to create a class 'Student' which can store three values: last name, first name, and ID
//
// The class is already started and already has a constructor, which takes in the three initial values.
//
// TODO:
// 1. Create three instance variables. These instance variables should all be set as private, which means that they are not visible (in scope) to any other class. In other words, these variables are encapsulated.
//
// 2. Provide public accessors for each of the instance variables in the Student class. In other words, you will need 3 "getters" that "expose" the underlying values. //
//
// 3. In the constructor, set the instance variables to the initial values that are passed in as parameters.

// Note: You are allowing other objects to access the instance variable, but as opposed to the previous exercise, you are now adding an extra layer of protection by requiring
// the use of an accessor. This is an example of encapsulation, aka data protection, which is one of the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming. If you do not want other
// objects to have access to these values, then you simply don't provide an accessor.


class Student {

    //create the instance variables here
    
    //create the constructor here
    
    //create the accessors here

}
