/*
Create an InchWorm class that will simulate an object that exists on a number line in a one-dimensional world. An Inchworm can be moved in either a positive (+1) or negative (-1) direction one unit at a time. The class will have two instance variables: position and direction. 

Members (a.k.a fields)
	position
	direction

Constructors:
	-first constructor takes no arguments; the initial position should default to zero
	-second constructor takes the initial position as a parameter of type int
	-both constructors should default the direction to 1

Methods
	move(): moves the InchWorm one unit in the direction that it is currently facing.
	turn(): reverses the InchWorm's direction.
	accessor for position
	accessor for direction
